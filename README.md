Submission for Ultimate Data Science Competition hosted by UTD's Data Science Club at UTD with cooperation from Lennox International. Since this does not have the data from Lennox International, I believe it is fine to share.

What was the Ultimate Data Science Competition?
It was a the first-ever data-science competition at University of Texas at Dallas. Lennox International requested UTD students to try to predict foottraffic using current machine learning technologies and provide a visualization to help executives understand what insights the machine learning tool has found.

How far did we get?
I managed to filter the data in Tableau and merge tables to have a clean dataset. However, the dataset's real-world complexity proved to be extremely difficult to adjust to a machine learning model (I tried using graident-boosted trees with minimal success). I then focused on visualization - trying to visualize the model's insights in LightGBM.
